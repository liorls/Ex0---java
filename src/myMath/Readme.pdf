design details: 
(*) an interface polynomable implements 
      an interface cont_func implements 
      an interface function 
 a class Monom implements the interface function
a class Polynom implements the interface polynomable

(*)  the class Polynom was designed as a collection (array list) of single monoms, 
enable invoking pre-written funcs of the monom class on each element of the polynom, preventing code repeatition and enable testing of each modular unit according to the OOP principles. 

 Implementation details:
(*) integral calculation via Ryman intergral: the middle of each step is chosen arbitrary
(*) in the substract function, a copy ctor was invoked in order to not change the original polynom (see details inside)
(*) in funcs as add and multiply, the monom version was invoked for each element of the polynom (as the design states)
(*) in most of the funcs, the traversal been done with "for each" or iterator, 
however in the derative func it was done with normal for, because of the need to change the current element being traversed.
